### The questions that the team plans to answer with the project (20 points)
The group final project aims to analyze video game sales and review data and answer three questions: (1) which genres of games perform well in specific regions, (2) the overall performance of games through sales-driven data, and (3) sales performance based on console. The project can be approached by following four steps: data cleaning, data exploration, data analysis, and data visualization. To analyze the data, we will use programming languages such as Python, Postgress, Tableau, Supervised Machine Learning, and Microsoft Excel.
